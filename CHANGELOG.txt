Version: 0.0.11
Date: 2025-05-09
Changes:
  - SpanMan will now only redraw sections of the screen that have changed
TODO:
  - SpanMan's partial redraws could be more efficient by indexing spans by line
  - SpanMan could be smarter about redrawing regions by combining all relevant
    spans into one to avoid overdraw.

Version: 0.0.10
Date: 2025-05-09
Features:
  - Add `SpanMan` class, which can be used to track the state of many
    `PSTextSpan`s on the screen and will generate `DrawCommand`s to update
    the screen on demand.
  - Currently `SpanMan` is quite dumb and will emit `DrawCommand`s to redraw
    the entire screen every time, but the API shouldn't need to change
    (much) to support incremental updates.
